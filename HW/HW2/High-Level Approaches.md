My immediate thought for approaching this porblem was to code one of the fastest searching algorithms
since I realized this was a search porblem. I googled the fastest search algorithm and found binary search
so i modeled my solution after binary search. The only difference here was that our starting index was 1
rather than 0, and I had a variable "prev" to keep track of the last version that evaluated to bad given
the problems API.
