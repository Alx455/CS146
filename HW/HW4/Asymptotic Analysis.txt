Analysys for Insertion sort:
Best case: 
           The elements are already sorted thus the time complexity will
           be O(n) as it will only iterate through the outer while loop,
           the inner while loop condition will never evaluate to true, so
           the inner loop will never run.
Average case:
           The elements are unsorted
Worst case:
           The elements are sorted in the opposite order in which inserrtion
           sort is designed to sort them(in most cases, insertion sort orders
           elements in ascending order, so the worst case would be elements
           sorted in ascending order, or vice versa). The time comlexity would
           be O(n^2) as the outer while loop would run N times, and the inner
           loop would run more iterations as the sorted left subarray grows.
           The amount of times the inner loop would run approaches N times.
