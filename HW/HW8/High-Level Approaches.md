My immediate idea to approach this problem was to make a HashMap and
store the count of each letter occurence in it as the value. I noticed
in the sample intput/output, that the longest palindromes were made of
all the letters that had an even count, and the one letter that had
the greatest odd count. This made the problem very simple and just a
matter of counting these two things together after having set up the
HashMap.
