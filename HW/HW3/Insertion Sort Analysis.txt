Insertion Sort pseudo:

i ← 1                                     # c1
while i < length(A)                       # N
    j ← i                                 # c2
    while j > 0 and A[j-1] > A[j]         # N(N - k)
        swap A[j] and A[j-1]              # c3
        j ← j - 1                         # c4
    end while                             
    i ← i + 1                             # c5
end while

The function of insertion sort is in the polynomial form
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
This function has an exponential order of growth and its time complexitry is n^2
