My approach to this was fairly simple. I took the recursive approach, and esentially decided to
recurse from the bottom of the BST. I check if the current node has at least one child, then I switch
the position of that child with the position of the other child(or the other open positon if the other
child does not exist). This is done recirsively until the entire BST is inverted.
