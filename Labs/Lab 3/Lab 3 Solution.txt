Problem 1:
1. 10000000000n^(2) vs n^(3)
    n^(3) is greater.
    Although 10000000000n^(2) has a large constant, n^(3) grows at a
    faster rate due to it being a larger exponent.

2. n^(2)log(n) vs n(log(n))^(10)
    n^(2)log(n) is greater.
    The second function can be manipulated into 10nlog(n), which makes
    the comparison much more clear. You can then see n^(2)log(n) grows
    at a faster rate than 10nlog(n) because of its exponent.

3. n^(log(n)) vs 2^(root(n))
    n^(log(n)) is greater.
    First you take the log of both sides so you can bring down the 
    exponent. Resulting in:
    log(n)log(n) vs root(n)log(2)
    log(n)^2 vs root(n)log(2)
    Then we take the log again to bring down the exponenet of the
    first function:
    2log(log(n)) vs log(root(n)log(2))


4. 2^(n) vs 2^(2n)
    2^(2n) is greater.
    This is failry simple as 2n is a greater exponent than n on its own.
