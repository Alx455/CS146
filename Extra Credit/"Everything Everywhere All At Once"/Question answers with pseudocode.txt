2. To convert an adjacency matrix to an adjacency list, you iterate throuhg the matrix with 2 loops.
   The outer loop iterates through the the column while the inner loop iterates through the row(this
   process can be carried out inversely, where the outer loop iterates through the row and the inner
   through the column). For each iteration of the outer loop, create a list and add it to a hashmap
   where they key is the node and the value is its adjacency list. The list created in the outer loop
   will store the values found in the row iterated by the inner loop.
   Pseudo:
   adjList = []
   for each i from 0 to column length
       list = []
       for each value in ith row
          add value to list
    adjList.key = i
    adjList.value = list
