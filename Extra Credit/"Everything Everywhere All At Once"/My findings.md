I found the reverseing a directed graph to be the easiest problem of the three. I simulated the
reversing on a piece of paper and realized it was just an inverted version of the orignal matrix
so the function itself was simple to code. 
As for the other two functions, I found them relati vely easy to implement because I made the
assumption that the verticies are denoted by integers and not other potential types like a string. 
The adjList being implemented as a hashMap actually makes it more universal as it is only a matter
of  changing the key type in order to fit whatever data type is used to represent each vertex. 
My adjacency list on the other hand might need some more work to make it handle verticies of different
types. Maybe simply adding another array that stores String that correspond to the according vertex
within the 2D Matrix.
