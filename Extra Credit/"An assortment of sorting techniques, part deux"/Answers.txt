We can use heaps as PQs(priority queue). For example, if we wanted to simulate a 
PQ of integers that prioritizes based on the smaller value, then we would implement
it as a minheap. The element that would be at the top of the simulated PQ would
then be the root of our minheap. To simulate our queue pop, we would just delete the
root node in our minheap. Pushing elements into our simulated PQ would be
taken care of by our heap property. Essentially, our heap property maintains the
priority of our integer elements.
For example, in our minheap below, deleting our root is the same as popping off the
top of our equivalent PQ

minHeap = {1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 6, 9}         // the equivalent PQ is {1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 12}
array.
